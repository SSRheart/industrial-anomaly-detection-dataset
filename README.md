The synthesized PCB dataset that has 1386 images with 6 types of common defects, including missing hole, mouse bite, open circuit, short, spur, spurious copper. Half of the images are for the situation where a test PCB is placed correctly, while other half is set for simulating the situation when the test board is randomly orientated in the workbench.
