+ **PKU-Market-PCB**: The dataset has 1386 images with 6 types of common defects, including missing hole, mouse bite, open circuit, short, spur, spurious copper. Half of the images are for the situation where a test PCB is placed correctly, while other half is set for simulating the situation when the test board is randomly orientated in the workbench.[[Link]](http://robotics.pkusz.edu.cn/resources/dataset/) or [[Link]](https://www.dropbox.com/s/32kolsaa45z2mpj/PCB_DATASET.zip?dl=0)
